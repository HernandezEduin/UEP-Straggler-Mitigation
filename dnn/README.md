# Deep Learning Model

Proof of Concept for Distributed Matrix Multiplication in Deep Learning Model. The code uses the decoding probability of the UEP codes to erase the computed sub-block if it did not arrive by the deadline.

The deep learning layers are built from scratch using both numpy and scipy. Keras library is called only to access the dataset. 

# Requirements
pip install tqdm
pip install keras
pip install scikit-image
